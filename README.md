IF statements are statements that will only do what you tell them if a certain condition you set was made.

Else statements are CONNECTED AND RELIANT on if statements to exist and will only do what you till them if the if 
statement's condition wasn't met.

Else-If statements are basically if statements connected to if statements. where you can set a NEW condition that does
something different.
